The Open-Source Star Cluster Multi-Purpose Toolkit. (Its results are better than this acronym.)

## November 2023

Previously, this was a private repo containing code I used in my PhD: it's now public!

Over time, I'd like to develop this codebase further. I'd especially really like to involve members of the community and make this a useful toolbox of reliable, fast code for working with star cluster data in the era of Gaia. Message me if there's anything you'd like to add!

I currently expect to get time to start working on properly documenting and publishing this code in 2024; before then, feel free to use whatever you can find =)
