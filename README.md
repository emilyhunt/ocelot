# ocelot
The Open ClustEr muLti-purpOse Toolkit. Its results are better than its acronyms.


## Acronym list
Throughout the project, every effort has been made to _not_ use unnecessary acronyms. However, in various places, acronyms were essential to cut down on the length of e.g. function names! A complete list of all used is given here.

### Module acronyms

* ACG: Alfred Castro-Ginard, whose 2018 DBSCAN paper inspired parts of this module.

* kNN: kth nearest neighbor. For instance, a star in a cluster has a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc nearest neighbor. Many clustering algorithms take arrays of the nearest neighbors of points as input.

* NN: nearest neighbor. For instance, a star in a cluster has a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc nearest neighbor. Many clustering algorithms take arrays of the nearest neighbors of points as input.

* SNR/snr: signal to noise ratio.

* TCG: Tristan Cantat-Gaudin, who has authored many recent papers (e.g. TCG+18, TCG+19) that use UPMASK to try and detect open clusters.

### Gaia acronyms

* ra, $\alpha$: right ascension

* dec, $\delta$: declination

* pmra, $\mu_\alpha$: proper motion in the right ascension direction (pre-multiplied by cos(dec)).

* pmdec, $\mu_\delta$: proper motion in the declination direction
