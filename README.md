The Open ClustEr muLti-purpOse Toolkit. Its results are better than its acronyms.


## Acronym list
Throughout the project, every effort has been made to _not_ use unnecessary acronyms. However, in various places, acronyms were essential to cut down on the length of e.g. function names! A complete list of all used is given here.

* ACG: Alfred Castro-Ginard, whose 2018 DBSCAN paper inspired parts of this module.

* kNN: kth nearest neighbor. For instance, a star in a cluster has a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc nearest neighbor. Many clustering algorithms take arrays of the nearest neighbors of points as input.
