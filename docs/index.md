# `ocelot` is in development!

This project is a spin-out from code that I wrote during my PhD. It's currently in alpha / active development.

## :warning: Which parts of ocelot are ready to use? :warning:

The following parts of the library have **stable APIs**, and are ready to use in production code:

- ocelot.simulate - for simulating star clusters.
- ocelot.model - various models useful to users of star clusters

The following parts are likely to be completely overhauled in the next few months:

- ocelot.calculate
- ocelot.cluster
- ocelot.crossmatch
- ocelot.isochrone

With that in mind, check out [how to install ocelot](installation.md).
