# `ocelot` is in development!

This project is a spin-out from code that Emily wrote during her PhD. It's currently in alpha / active development - check back here soon for the first production-ready versions!

> :warning: Impending API changes

I've learnt a lot about programming in the last 5 years, so I intend to completely overhaul `ocelot`'s API to be cleaner. However, that means pretty much everything here is subject to change for now.

## Commands for docs

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Docs layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
